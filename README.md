# Easy Auto Click
Welcome to my page! The aim for this program is to provide a simple method for your autoclicking needs. Currently, this program supports simple mouse click functions (click down, then up). I am working to add more complicated features moving forward. Such features are:
More complex mouse clicking functions
* Keyboard button press functionality (single char to strings of words).
* User specified time between start click and release click.
* Event log chronoligizing click/keyboard events.
* Progress bar to indicate time to completion.
* Visible timer to also do that.
 
If you would like to download the latest pre-release version, click on the "Releases" button on the right side of this page.  

And that's all I can think of for now. Feel free to leave ideas!
